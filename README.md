# Smart-Collision-Preventing-System-for-Automobiles
Vehicle technology has increased rapidly in recent years, particularly in relation to Sensing and detecting systems. In parallel to the developments sensors have been developed that are capable of detecting physical obstacles, other vehicles or pedestrian around the vehicle. A method of preventing an accident using ultrasonic technology. This project focuses on building a user-friendly device that specializes in detecting intrusions besides doing close range obstacle detection. Automobile safety can be improved by anticipating a crash before it occurs and thereby providing additional time to deploy safety technologies. The sensors in the car would be capable of detecting even in the poor conditions and would inform the driver distance from the various objects in front of the car which will help the driver to drive safely in such poor conditions. For example rain, smoke, fog affects visibility, the sensors would recognize another car and alert the driver of any dangers that lie ahead, giving the driver enough time to slow down, allowing him to escape from what could have been a bad accident. The project’s ultimate aim thus finalized as, one to build a general, easy-to-use and versatile system that can prevent fatal accidents.
